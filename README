DESCRIPTION
===========

This program has been created to aid open source spectrum
analyzer development for Qualcomm/Atheros AR92xx and AR93xx
based chipsets. 

It dumps the FFT data reported by the chips in JSON format to
help intepreting and understanding the data.

TODO: The interpreted data format is unknown! Please help
investigating the data, or help acquiring information about the
data format from Qualcomm Atheros!

BUILD
=====

You need to have make and gcc.

Just type make to build the program:

$ make
gcc -O2 -Wall -pedantic -c -o fft_eval.o fft_eval.c
gcc -o fft_eval fft_eval.o -lm
$

USAGE
=====

First, you need to acquire sample data from your spectral-scan enabled
Atheros WiFi card. If the patches are applied correctly, you can use
the following commands:

ifconfig wlan0 up
iw dev wlan0 scan spec-scan
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/spectral_scan > /tmp/fft_results

There are some recorded samples in the "samples" directory to try it
out without actual hardware.

To view the FFT results, use:

./fft_eval /tmp/fft_results
